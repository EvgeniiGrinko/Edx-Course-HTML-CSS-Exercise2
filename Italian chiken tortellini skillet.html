    <p id = "description">This Italian Chicken Tortellini Skillet is an en easy meal made completely in one pot ‚Äî loaded with roasted red peppers, spinach, tomatoes, herbs and cheese! <br>Tortellini isn‚Äôt something I buy often (or really ever, for that matter). It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy tortellini, it‚Äôs probably because I enjoy it a little too much, if you know what I mean.

        Those delicate, cheese-stuffed pillows of pasta are completely irresistible but not so light on the calorie side of things, so I usually stick to whole grain, whole wheat or high fiber pasta of another sort.
        
        But I passed the frozen aisle in the grocery store a while back and there was a great deal on a 1kg bag of frozen cheese tortellini, and I thought, ‚Äúwhat the heck?‚Äù
        
        And I just wanted to make something classic, and boring, and seriously delicious but moderately healthy. So I used chicken broth and milk to make my sauce and loaded it up with chicken, tomatoes, spinach and roasted red peppers, and stirred in a just enough cheese because, well ‚Äî cheese.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Pizza dough is a yeasted dough which requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.

    <br> You can use all purpose flour instead of the bread flour that is called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.
    
    <br> Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.</p>
